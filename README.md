# Machine-Learning---3rd-Problem

The project’s second part is devoted to analyzing satellite images of Mars showing meteorite impact craters. Impact craters are an essential source of information about Mars’s geology and surface characteristics, and automatizing their detection in the images is essential.
Our goal was to distinguish between images with and without craters.

This repository have the jupyter notebooks with the all implementations to solve the second problem and some python files with functions that we quote on our final report.
